# Introduce
First of all, let me introduce myself, my name is Hasbi Alamsyah, here I am making a simple project about CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete)
using NodeJS and its Package Managers such as Express, Mongoose, Method-Override and others. This is my first project in JavaScript so sorry if there are any shortcomings in my explanation.

# Learn Step-by-step to install the project
So here I am doing simple CRUD using package managers from NPM such as Express, Mongoose, and Method-Override so let me explain how to use these package managers.

**1. Install NPM**
To use a package manager, of course we have to install npm first on our project, why? so we can install package managers provided by NPM such as Express, Mongoose, and others.
How to install NPM is quite easy, we just need to type `npm init` in the project and then you can install package managers Express, Mongoose, and Method-Override


**2. Install the required Package Manager**
You must install a package manager before using this project. The package managers you must install are Express, Mongoose, Method-Override, and EJS.
To install it, simply type the following command in the terminal where this project is located:
`npm i express mongoose method-override ejs`

**3. Set up the database with MongoDB**
After installing the package manager you have to create a MongoDB database and create a collection with the name you want.
After that, you replace the database URL with the name of your database in the utils/database.js directory and also change it according to the name of the collection you created in the models/items.js directory.

**4. Finish**
After doing all that, you can use this simple CRUD application. If there is a problem, please let me know and provide criticism and suggestions so that I can make the project even better :call_me_hand: .
