# Javascript-Simple-CRUD
In this simple CRUD project I use NodeJS along with a package manager like Mongoose to connect to the database, EJS for the view engine and Method Overrides so you can use the put and delete methods. If there is a problem in my project, don't forget to leave criticism and suggestions so that I can develop even better
